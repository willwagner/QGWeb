_The 2 Ball Circle Game is a great way to work on those pressure packed short putts_

# The Rules of the Game

The game itself is simple.  You start 2 feet away from the hole, putting 2 to 3 balls 6 inches apart circling the hole.  You start with the first one and work yourself around an imaginary circle around the hole.

Every time you make two putts in a row, move back one foot (e.g. move from putting 2' putts to 3' putts).  If you miss 2 putts in a row, the game ends.  A variation of this game is to do 3 ball circle wherein if you make 3 in a row, you move back a foot and if you miss 3 in a row, the game ends.


# Why it's great

I love this game because it really challenges you each and every putt.  Each putt is instrumental in either advancing or losing the game, keeping you challenged. Because you are circling the hole, each putt is slightly different in regards to the break, but not so much that you have to spend a lot of time reading the break. The challenge ramps up pretty fast.

My personal record is getting to 11' which is well outside my typical game which ends somewhere around 6-7' but many times much less. 

Give a try!
