# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** {{ "now" | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}

This Privacy Policy describes how Will Wagner ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Quantified Golf mobile application ("App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### Important Note About Data Storage

**The Quantified Golf App does not use a server for storing your personal data.** All user data, including golf scores, statistics, practice sessions, and other golf-related information you enter into the App, is stored only on your device. Your data is never transmitted to our servers and remains completely private and under your control.

### Information You Provide

- **Golf Data:** Scores, statistics, practice session data, and other golf-related information you enter into the App (stored locally on your device only)
- **Profile Information:** Optional profile information you choose to provide (stored locally on your device only)

### Information Automatically Collected

- **Usage and Crash Statistics:** We may collect anonymized usage data and crash reports to help improve the App. This may include:
  - App performance metrics
  - Crash logs and error reports
  - Feature usage statistics (which features are used most frequently)
  - Device type and operating system version

This analytics data is collected through third-party services (such as Apple's App Analytics) and does not include your personal golf data or personally identifiable information. These statistics help us understand how the App is used and identify areas for improvement.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the App
- Process your requests and transactions
- Send you technical notices and support messages
- Respond to your comments and questions
- Monitor and analyze usage patterns
- Detect, prevent, and address technical issues
- Personalize your experience

## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. **As the App stores all user data locally on your device and does not use a server, we do not have access to your golf data, scores, statistics, or practice sessions.**

### Analytics and Crash Reporting Services

We may share anonymized usage and crash statistics with third-party analytics services to help improve the App. This data does not include your personal golf data or personally identifiable information. These services are used solely for:
- Understanding app performance
- Identifying and fixing bugs
- Improving user experience

These analytics services are bound by their own privacy policies and confidentiality obligations.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

### Business Transfers

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 4. Data Security

**Your golf data is stored locally on your device only.** Since we do not transmit or store your golf data on our servers, your data is protected by your device's built-in security features (such as device encryption, passcode protection, Face ID, or Touch ID).

We implement appropriate technical measures for any analytics data we do collect. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security for analytics data transmitted to our analytics providers.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Update

You can access and update all your data directly through the App, as all data is stored locally on your device.

### Location Services

You can control location data collection through your device's privacy settings.

### Data Deletion

Since all your golf data is stored locally on your device, you can delete your data at any time by:
- Deleting the App from your device (which removes all locally stored data)
- Using the App's settings to clear your data (if available)

If you have any questions about data deletion, please contact us at [support@quantifiedgolf.com](mailto:support@quantifiedgolf.com).

### California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including:
- The right to know what personal information we collect
- The right to delete your personal information
- The right to opt-out of the sale of personal information (we do not sell personal information)

## 6. Data Retention

**Your golf data remains on your device until you delete the App or manually delete the data within the App.** We do not retain copies of your golf data since it is never transmitted to our servers.

For any anonymized analytics and crash statistics we collect, we retain this information only as long as necessary to improve the App and analyze usage patterns, typically for a period not exceeding two years.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## 8. Third-Party Links

The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.

## 9. International Data Transfers

**Your golf data is not transferred anywhere, as it remains stored only on your device.** However, any anonymized analytics and crash statistics may be processed by analytics service providers that may operate in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your country.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

For material changes, we will provide additional notice, such as an email notification or a notice in the App.
